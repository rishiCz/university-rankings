# How to run

1.  Clone the project to your machine using:  
    `git clone https://github.com/rishiCz/university-rankings.git`
    
2.  Navigate into the **university-rankings** folder:  
    `cd university-rankings`
    
3.  Install all dependencies by running:  
    `npm install`
    

> **Note:** Make sure ports **3000** and **8000** are not already in use.

4.  If you are starting the project for the very first time, run:  
    `npm run first-start`  
    This command will:
    
    -   Generate the Prisma client
        
    -   Build the Next.js project
        
    -   Start the server
        
5.  If you have already used the above command before and want to start the server again, run:  
    `npm run start`
